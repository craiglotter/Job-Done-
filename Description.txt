Job Done!

Job Done! (Mail Message) simply displays a "Job done" text message that is used in email replies to Commerce IT web clients after their requests have been dealt with. The idea is that on a single button press, the application randomly displays one of the preset "Job Done" text messages and copies the text to the clipboard, thus speeding up the email compilation step.
